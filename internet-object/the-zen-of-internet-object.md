### Poem

Size holds weight, in bytes confined, \
Small prevails, large left behind.&#x20;

Simplicity shines over complexity's shroud,\
Readability echoes, accurate and loud.

Reusability births productivity's rise,\
Verbosity's burden efficiency defies.



Data, definitions, separate ways,\
Together they clutter, apart they amaze.

Headers and data, distinctions drawn,\
Confusion dissolves, clarity's dawn.

Errors and statuses, data's divide,\
Their entanglement brings chaos inside.



Two lone records, states unswayed,\
No interference, connections unmade.

Trust not the sender, vigilance displayed,\
Expect the unanticipated, foundations laid.

Surprises, enchanting, yet beware,\
Not all of them good, handle with care.
