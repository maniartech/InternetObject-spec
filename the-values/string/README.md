# String

Like many programming languages, strings in Internet Object are a sequence of Unicode codepoints. They may be enclosed in quotation marks `(" U+0022 or ' U+0027)` or remain free without being enclosed. One noticeable difference with Internet Object strings is they all preserve the whitespace found within the boundary!

### String Formats

The Internet Object strings can be written in three different formats (a) Open Strings (b) Regular Strings (c) Raw Strings. All of these formats have different ways of representing strings and handling escapes.

{% hint style="info" %}
All formats of strings in Internet Object preserve the whitespaces or any permissible codepoint found within the string boundary.
